  1.  PROJECT STRUCTURE

  
├── server.js              Main server file (Node.js)  
├── css/  
│   └── styles.css         CSS styling for all pages  
└── pages/  
    ├── home.html          Home page  
    ├── about.html         About page  
    ├── contact.html       Contact page  
    ├── services.html      Services page  
    └── 404.html           404 error page  


  2.  HOW THE SERVER WORKS


1. SERVER CREATION:  
   - The server is built using Node.js's built-in 'http' module.  
   - It listens on port 3000 for incoming requests.  
   - It uses the 'fs' module to read HTML files asynchronously.  
   - It uses the 'path' module to manage file paths.  

2. ROUTING LOGIC:  
   - When a user visits '/' or '/home', the home page is served.  
   - When a user visits '/about', the about page is served.  
   - When a user visits '/contact', the contact page is served.  
   - When a user visits '/services', the services page is served (extra route).  
   - When a user visits '/styles.css', the CSS file is served.  
   - Any other route will display the custom 404 error page.  

3. MODULAR FUNCTIONS:  
   - serveFile() reads the file and sends a response with the proper content type.  
   - serve404Page() handles invalid routes and shows the error page.  

4. ASYNCHRONOUS FILE READING:  
   - The server uses fs.readFile(), which is non-blocking.  
   - This allows the server to handle multiple requests at the same time.  
   - It improves performance compared to synchronous reading.  

5. ERROR HANDLING:  
   - If the requested route is not found, the server serves the 404 page.  
   - If file reading fails, a plain text error message is displayed.  
   - Proper HTTP status codes are used (200 for success and 404 for not found).  


3. ROUTES IMPLEMENTED


Route           | URL                              | Description  
 
Home            | http://localhost:3000/home       | Main landing page  
About           | http://localhost:3000/about      | Company information page  
Contact         | http://localhost:3000/contact    | Contact form and details  
Services        | http://localhost:3000/services   | Laundry services with prices  
404 Error       | http://localhost:3000/xyz        | Custom error page

4.TESTING RESULTS


Route           | Status Code  | Result  
----------------|--------------|------------------------------------------  
/home           | 200 OK       | Page loads successfully and style  
/about          | 200 OK       | Page loads successfully and style
/contact        | 200 OK       | Page loads successfully and style 
/services       | 200 OK       | Page loads successfully and style 
/styles.css     | 200 OK       | CSS file served correctly  
/invalid-route  | 404 Not Found| Custom 404 page displayed correctly  


5.SERVER CONSOLE LOG

Step 1: Clone the repository  
        git clone https://github.com/Virang41/server.git  

Step 2: Open the terminal in the project folder  

Step 3: Run the server  
        node server.js  

Step 4: Open a browser and go to  
        http://localhost:3000
